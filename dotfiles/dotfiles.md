# Rules for Dotfiles (Inspired by Jess Archer, Vimconf 2021)
* Version control your dot files
* Split out plugin configs to their own files
* Keep comments minimal
* Add key maps to quickly get to config file and to reload it
* Only add things when you notice something you don't like about the defaults
* For plugins, re-assess the available options and **read the docs**
* If a config change is quick, do it right away
* Otherwise make a note and recularly make time to hone your config

# What Plugins am I Considering?
* colorschemes : gruvbox, dracula, papercolor
